Database Design

1. There are three models Users, Images, and Albums.

2. Users can have many images which they can view direct through thier account window. They can have many albums which they can view directly through thier album window. Albums need at least one image, every image needs to be in at least one album. The default album, which has the same id as the image does.

ToDo

1. Remove userinfo from recentimages api call if not needed.

2. Add file verification for images. JPG are {255,216,255,224}, .BMP are {66,77}, .GIF are {71,73,70,56}, .PNG are {137,80,78,71}

3. Verify that params from users are strings in order to prevent injection attacks.
